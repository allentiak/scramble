# allentiak/scramble

FIXME: my new application.

## About

Scramblies challenge

### Task 1: Backend

Complete the function (scramble? str1 str2) that returns true if a portion of str1 characters can be rearranged to match str2, otherwise returns false.

Notes:

- Only lower case letters will be used (a-z). No punctuation or digits will be included.
- Performance needs to be considered.

Examples:

    (scramble? "rekqodlw" "world") ==> true
    (scramble? "cedewaraaossoqqyt" "codewars") ==> true
    (scramble? "katas" "steak") ==> false

### Task 2: REST API

Create a web service that accepts two strings in a request and applies function scramble? from previous task to them.

### Task 3: UI

Create a UI in ClojureScript with two inputs for strings and a scramble button. When the button is fired it should call the API from previous task and display a result.
Notes

Please pay attention to tests, code readability and error cases.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

Run the project directly, via `:exec-fn`:

    $ clojure -X:run-x
    Hello, Clojure!

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -X:run-x :name '"Someone"'
    Hello, Someone!

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m allentiak.scramble`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m
    Hello, World!

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -M:run-m Via-Main
    Hello, Via-Main!

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj`.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/net.clojars.allentiak/scramble-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
